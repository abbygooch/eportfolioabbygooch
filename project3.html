            <h2>About the Usability Tests</h2>
            <p>For this project, I went through the entire process of administering a usability test. I started by writing out a script; I thought out some questions that would help me gauge how effect my guides were and highlight any improvements I needed to make. After my script was written, I wrote out consent forms for my particpants. Once I had signed consent forms for my participants, I completed usability tests for both my Print User Guide and my Video User Guide following the scripts I'd prepared. </p>

            <h2>Skills Gained</h2>
            <p>This was one of my favorite projects in this course, and I feel like I gained a lot from it. For one, I got practice writing professionally in both my script and my consent forms. What I really enjoyed, though, was the actual usability testing. Throughout my tests, I practiced professionally hosting a meeting, communicating, and active listening. I also got practice in note-taking during a meeting, which I will definitely use in my future career.</p>
